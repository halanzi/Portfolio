                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

					It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
				</p></div><div class="lineAnim hidden"><p>
					Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                    and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

				Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

			<p><b>Controlling expression and genetic circuits</b></p>
			<p>
				Our ability to understand and control disease depends on our ability to
				control the genes underlying it. Synthetic biology allows us to
				repurpose systems with unrelated biological functions into tools for
				manipulating gene expression.
			</p><p>
				My Ph.D. research with the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://web.mit.edu/nileslab/">Niles Lab</a> at
				MIT focuses on developing these kinds of tools for use in the malaria
				parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. By combining recombinant
				gene expression systems, deep learning, and genetic screening, I
				try to understand how parasites control gene expression and how we can
				build synthetic ways of doing so [in prep.].
			</p><p>
				Besides building tools to manipulate gene expression, it is important to
				understand how these tools function together. Genetic circuits exhibit
				context-dependent, emergent behaviors such as resource sharing, which
				complicate their use. In collaboration with the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://scripts.mit.edu/~ddv/index.php">
				Del Vecchio lab</a> at MIT, I helped assemble and model genetic
				devices to reduce these effects in model gene circuits
				<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.246561">
					[preprint]</a>.
			</p><p>
				Finally, I have built and modeled gene circuits for applications
				in new treatment strategies for bacterial disease, both as a member of
				<a target="_blank" href="https://eligo.bio/">
				Eligo Bioscience</a> and in collaboration with the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://collinslab.mit.edu/">Collins lab</a> at
				MIT [in prep.].

			<br><br>
			<p><b>Probing and targeting pathogen genes</b></p>
			<p>
				We can use engineered control of gene expression and bioinformatics
				to tease apart how pathogens live and die. This knowledge opens new
				paths to approach drug and vaccine design in a more informed manner.
			</p><p>
				Despite still killing more than 400,000 people a year, 70% of
				<i>P. falciparum</i> genes have unknown or hypothetical functions. To
				remedy this, I develop computational tools to
				<a target="_blank" href="https://pablo-cardenas.com/Plasmodium_Interactome/">visualize gene interactions</a> and
				<a target="_blank" href="http://genetargeter.mit.edu/">design gene editing</a>
				for assaying gene function at a massive scale, as a part of the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://web.mit.edu/nileslab/">Niles Lab</a>.
				In addition, I use statistical approaches to interpret
				protein-compound interactions in order to establish potential drug
				targets and lead compounds [in prep.].
			</p><p>
				Another situation where we need a better understanding of gene function
				is bacterial persistence, the phenomenon in which bacteria
				stochastically enter a metabolic state that allows them to survive an
				antibiotic, despite being genetically susceptible. As a part of the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://paulsson.med.harvard.edu/">Paulsson
					Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School, I used microfluidics and live
				cell microscopy to screen gene function related to persistence in
				<i>Escherichia coli</i>.
			</p><p>
				COVID-19 took the research world by storm, and understanding variation
				within the genes of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to developing vaccines. With
				collaborators at UMass Medical School and Emory University, I
				carry our bioinformatic analyses of gene conservation and epitope
				affinity to inform vaccine candidate design.
			</p>

			<img id="research" alt="Evolution" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:12px;margin-right:12px;border-radius: 50%; background-color:white;" src="./assets/img/Dialectic.png" width="200px" />
			<br><br>
			<p><b>Modeling pathogen evolution</b></p>
			<p>
				One of the most clinically relevant instances of evolutionary biology is
				resistance to treatment in a pathogen. Mathematical and
				computational models are useful to study evolution as they allow us to
				run virtual experiments that would otherwise be too large or too long to
				realistically do.
			</p><p>
				The most common instance of resistance to treatment is
				antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Resistant bacteria in a biofilm may
				incur in fitness costs, and yet the benefits of resistance can often be
				shared among its neighbors. As a part of
				<a target="_blank" href="https://mtbi.asu.edu/">MTBI at Arizona State
					University</a>, I co-developed
				<a target="_blank" href="https://mtbi.asu.edu/content/cheating-cheaters-spatial-dynamics-evolutionary-stability-antibiotic-resistance">
					a 3-D, spatially explicit agent-based model of bacterial
					resistance</a>, to study spatial dynamics and competition within
				biofilms that can be harnessed to reduce resistance [<a target="_blank" href="https://mtbi.asu.edu/content/cheating-cheaters-spatial-dynamics-evolutionary-stability-antibiotic-resistance">technical report</a>].
			</p><p>
				Phage therapy is an intriguing alternative to antibiotics, but is also
				subject to evolution of bacterial resistance. Although phage are capable
				of evolving too, this coevolution can be difficult to achieve.
				To make phage into effective therapeutic agents, we need ways of
				inhibiting bacterial evolution of resistance. At the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://cimic.uniandes.edu.co/"> CIMIC
				  lab</a> at Universidad de los Andes, I contributed to the development
				and validation of
				<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020188">a dynamical
					model of phage therapy showing the potential of combining phage
				cocktails and antibiotics</a>, even when the antibiotic is ineffective
				by itself [<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020188">article</a>].
			</p><p>
				Of course, evolution also occurs beyond the level of a single host. To
				study scenarios of evolution at the epidemiological scale, I developed
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pablocarderam/opqua">
					a computational framework to stochastically model genetically evolving
					pathogens spreading through populations of hosts</a>. With the help of
				an international work group of collaborators in Colombia, USA, and
				Europe, we are applying these kinds of models to study the emergence and
				spread of antimalarial resistance, and the genomic epidemiology of
				malaria along the Colombian Pacific coast.
